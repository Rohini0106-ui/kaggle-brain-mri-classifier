# kaggle-brain-mri-classifier
Kaggle Brain Tumor Classification is an AI-powered deep learning project designed to analyze and classify brain MRI scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project integrates the Kaggle API for seamless dataset access, employs advanced preprocessing techniques for image enhancement, and utilizes transfer learning (ResNet50) for accurate tumor detection. The goal is to create a reproducible, end-to-end pipeline that not only classifies MRI images into tumor categories but also visualizes the regions influencing the modelâ€™s predictions using Grad-CAM. Built and executed entirely in Google Colab, this project demonstrates how machine learning and neuroimaging can work together to advance medical diagnostics and research in brain health.
